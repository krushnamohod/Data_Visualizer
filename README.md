# 🚧 Visualization Dashboard (Work in Progress) 🚧  

Welcome to the **Visualization Dashboard** repository!  

## 📢 **Project Status**  
This project is currently under development. We are actively working to build an intuitive and professional dashboard that empowers users to:  
1. Upload datasets (drag-and-drop supported).  
2. Perform **visualization** of the data through various charts (e.g., histograms, line plots, correlation matrices, etc.).  
3. Conduct **statistical analysis** such as mean, median, mode, and more.  

Stay tuned for updates and new features! 🚀

## 📋 **Project Overview**  

The **Visualization Dashboard** will provide users with a seamless interface to:  

1. **Upload Datasets:**  
   - Users can upload datasets up to **100 MB** in size.  
   - The dashboard will process the dataset and offer intelligent insights.  

2. **AI-Generated Dataset Insights:**  
   - Using advanced AI tools, the system will analyze the dataset and generate a summary of its structure:  
     - Number and types of columns (e.g., categorical, integer, datetime).  
     - Basic observations based on the data's properties.  

3. **Interactive Dashboard Features:**  
   - Users can add tiles to:  
     - Visualize data through customizable charts.  
     - Perform statistical computations and view results.  

4. **Google Gemini AI Integration:**  
   - The assistant will offer real-time explanations and context-aware insights about the dataset and generated outputs.
